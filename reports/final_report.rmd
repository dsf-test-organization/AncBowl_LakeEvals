## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
<center>

!["Figure 1"](../output/length_histogram.png)

</center>




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
